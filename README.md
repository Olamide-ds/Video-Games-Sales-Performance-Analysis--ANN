ðŸŽ® Video Game Sales Performance Analysis

This project applies supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to predict and analyze global video game sales. Models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were used for prediction, while K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering were applied to uncover sales patterns across regions.

ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

Dataset: Video game sales dataset with 16,416 entries and 16 features

Goal: Predict global sales and identify sales performance patterns using machine learning

Techniques Used:

Regression Models: Linear, Polynomial, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

Clustering Models: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)

Evaluation Metrics: RÂ², MSE, RMSE, MAE, Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index

Key Result: The ANN model outperformed all others in accuracy, and Hierarchical Clustering showed the best clustering quality.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Jupyter Notebook
